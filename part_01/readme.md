# Part 1

Due: October 27, 2017

## Overview

In this section, you will be presenting three potential topics to your coursemates (and fellow well-wishers!) You will be presenting your findings in the form of a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk). 

#### Your Slides Must Be on Google Slides. No Exceptions!

## What is a lightning talk?

For our purposes, a lightning talk is a talk lasting **no more than five minutes**, in which you will discuss the following about your three proposed projects:

1. What your ultimate question is (i.e., what do you want to predict about the world?)
2. Why should we care / why do _you_ care? 
3. What data do you have available to answer it? What do you have in hand?

Time limits will be strictly enforced -- you will get a warning at 1 minute, however.

We will expect that you have a slide deck of some kind -- using Google Slides is _highly_ encouraged, however.

## Expectations

1. A slide deck and talk that answers the three questions about your proposed projects outlined above
2. The ability to intelligently answer any reasonable question about your project or data 

## Recommendations

Practice your talk beforehand! Talking in front of people takes a large amount of skill and distilling hours of work into no more than five minutes is even more difficult. 

Ruthlessly cut your presentation down to whatever facts need to be in front of your audience -- there will be (many) things that are very nice for your audience to know or that may be the subject of their questions. Cut your scheduled presentation to as small of a time as you can, but feel free to include additional slides at the end of your deck in preparation for any likely questions. 

Bolded and capitalized for as much effect as possible:

#### HAVE YOUR DATA IN HAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

There is no penalty for having to switch topics or datasets in the middle of the project, provided that you can still deliver on the other portions of this work. However, if you can get the data in hand as soon as possible, you can prevent yourself a lot of extra work. 

## Deliverables

1. Your presentation (on time!) on October 27, 2017
2. A Google Slides presentation (your presentation **must** be hosted on Google Slides. No Exceptions!)
